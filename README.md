# Raspberry-Pi-Voice-Control-With-MQTT
In this session, we’ll combine a few different technologies to implement a way to remote control simple tasks on your Raspberry Pi via voice commands. In our solution, the MQTT protocol will be used to broker remote communication between devices, creating a scalable home automation framework plugged into the Internet Of Things.  Hardware required: —Raspberry Pi —USB camera —LEDs and a buzzer —USB Microphone  Software required: —Visual Studio Code (http://code.visualstudio.com/Download) —Install Node.JS (http://nodejs.org/en/download/) &amp; follow these steps to set up React Native (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Social media: —Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings —Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings —Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #MQTT #RaspberryPi
